                    I am a computer engineering student at the University of Toronto with a strong background in software development, hardware design, and project leadership. Proficient in C++, C, Java, Python, JavaScript, Verilog, and Assembly, I have experience working with FPGA programming, microcontrollers, and embedded systems. My technical expertise extends to circuit design, CAD tools like SolidWorks and Quartus, and digital logic implementation. I am passionate about creating efficient, high-performance solutions that bridge the gap between software and hardware.
                    Beyond technical development, I have strong project management and leadership skills, demonstrated through my roles as a team leader, project manager, and student director. I have successfully led teams in engineering design competitions, coordinated project timelines using Microsoft Project, and guided students in programming and public speaking through leadership positions in academic clubs. As an active member of UofTâ€™s Engineering Society and robotics teams, I continuously strive to apply my knowledge in practical, impactful ways. You can explore my projects in the project page linked in the top right corner.
